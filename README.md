## Breaking news: We are under attack!

After their heavy defeat during the previous battle, ponies are back and are still aiming at taking over the world and finally subjugate humanity. Their new battle plan is about to start and our utmost fear may become reality, the ponies might have gathered new allies. 

Being one of the brave warriors who saved the world during the last epic battle or being a new fighter, we rely on you.
